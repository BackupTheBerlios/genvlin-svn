All the files here are based on the book:
"Java Number Cruncher"; The Java Programmer's Guide To Numerical Computing
from Ronald Mak (http://www.apropos-logic.com/nc/)

Thanks, to him and his book!!
I supposed that it is okay to put the code under the LGPL, because he says
in his book: "You're free to use the source code anyway you like, but bear
in mind that this is not fully tested, commercial-quality code. Neither
Prentice Hall nor I[Ronald Mak] can be responsible for anything bad that may
happen if you use these programs [and the library]."
